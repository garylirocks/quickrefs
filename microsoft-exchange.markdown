# Microsoft Exchange

## Concepts

- Contacts: people outside your organization you'd like everyone to be able to find in Outlook
- SharedMailbox: corresponds to a Entra user
- Sharing:
  - **Organization relationship**:
    - allow users in each org to view calendar availability info (eg. to schedule meetings)
    - need to be set on both sides
    - with another Microsoft 365 / Office 365 organization, or with an Exchange-online organization
    - access settings (eg. free/busy, time, subject, and location) are maximum allowed, individual users can choose to share less (select a calendar, then configure sharing)
  - **Individual sharing**:
    - By default, all users can invite anyone with an email address to view their calendar
    - Individual sharing controls how your users share their calendars with people outside your organization
    - You can choose "All domains" or specified domains
    - After you create a new sharing policy, you need to go to target mailboxes and apply the policy to make it take effects
