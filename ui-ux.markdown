* Placeholders

    [Don’t Use The Placeholder Attribute](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/06/placeholder-attribute/#comments-placeholder-attribute)

    This article suggests don't use placeholders, because:

    * Can’t be automatically translated;
    * Is oftentimes used in place of a label, locking out assistive technology;
    * Can hide important information when content is entered;
    * Can be too light-colored to be legible;
    * Has limited styling options;
    * May look like pre-filled information and be skipped over.

    Read the comments as well, there are some quite valid arguments there for keeping placeholders as a progressive enhancement measure.
