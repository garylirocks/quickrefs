## 虚拟语气

两种用法：

- 表与事实相反的假设情况
- 表愿望，请求，建议，命令

### 与事实相反的假设情况

| Cond. time        | Cond. v.                 | Main v.        | Example                                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Now               | past                     | would + v      | If I **saw** the rabbit now, I **would bite** him.             |
| Future (unlikely) | should + v / were to + v | would + v      | If I **should see** the rabbit tomorrow, I **would bite** him. |
| Past              | had + v                  | would have + v | If I **had seen** the rabbit now, I **would have bitten** him. |

- 和现在事实相反（想要发生的状况），动词用过去式 (这里的"would"是"will"的过去式)

  > If I **saw** the rabbit now, I **would bite** him.

  > // 无论什么人称，始终用were

  > If I **were** you, I **would give** it to him.

- 和过去的事实相反，条件去动词用过去完成式，主句动词用完成式

  > If I **had seen** the rabbit now, I **would have bitten** him.

- 未来的条件，动词用将来时

  > If I **see** the rabbit tomorrow, I **will bite** him.

- 未来的条件，但可能性很小，动词用 should + 动词原形 (这里的"should"是"shall"的过去式)

  > If I **should see** the rabbit tomorrow, I **would bite** him.

  > If I **were to see** the rabbit tomorrow, I **would bite** him.

### 愿望，请求，建议，命令

一般用"wish/would rather"表示愿望

*相比"hope", "wish"一般用于可能性小的情况*

- 现在

  > I wish (that) I were a rabbit

  > I would rather (that) you didn't eat the carrot

- 过去

  > I wish (that) I had eaten the carrot

- 将来

  > I wish (that) I could eat the carrot

其他用法:

- 主句: demand, suggest, insist, order
- 从句: (should) + 动词原形

> I demand/order/insist that you (should) eat a carrot

> I demanded/ordered/insisted that you (should) eat a carrot

> It is suggested/demanded/ordered/insisted that you (should) eat a carrot
