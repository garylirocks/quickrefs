## Overview

## Permissions management (CloudKnox)

- Microsoft Entra Permissions Management (formerly known as CloudKnox) is a cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM) solution.
- Detects, automatically right-sizes, and continuously monitors unused and excessive permissions.
- Enables Zero Trust security through least privilege access in Microsoft Azure, AWS, and GCP.
- At very granular permission level
- Ad-hoc, on-demand elevation
- Separate license based on resources scanned
