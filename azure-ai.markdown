## Azure vs. Power Platform

Some capabilities exist in both platforms

|             | Azure    | Power Platform |
| ----------- | -------- | -------------- |
| Usage       | Code     | Codeless       |
| Features    | More     |                |
| Cost        | Less     |                |
| Volume      | Higher   |                |
| Integration | Flexible |                |


## Copilot studio

- Re-branded from Power Virtual Agents
- You can
  - build a custom copilot
  - or extend a Microsoft Copilot
    - The built agent could be published anywhere, like Microsoft 365 Copilot (Teams, SharePoint, Business Chat)
- For none/low code usage, using natural language or a GUI

### Knowledge sources

You can connect it to your public websites or internal data (files, databases, etc)

### Topics

For certain specified phrases, you might want to control the response message or action, you can define a topic.

This is called *conversational orchestration*.


## Azure AI Studio
