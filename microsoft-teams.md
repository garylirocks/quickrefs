## Concepts

- **Team**
  - Made up of channels
  - Every team has at least one channel (usually called "General"), which can't be deleted
  - You could create an **org-wide team** that automatically adds everyone in your organization
  - You can create a team from a M365 group, you can see which M365 group has a team associated in the M365 Admin center

- **Channel**
  - Where files are shared, apps are added
  - Types:
    - Standard: accessible to all members in the team
    - Private: selected members
    - Shared: **TODO: how does this work? shared with guest users in other tenant ?**
  - Team members can adjust or limit notifications they're getting from a channel
  - Messages here are called **posts**, organized in threads


## Tips

- Access another account as a guest

  You have email address `john@tenant-a.com`, and been added to a chat in `tenant-b.com`, and get a reminder email. To access the chat in `tenant-b`, you need to quit Teams, then click a link in the email. (if not quitting, it will show you are not in the chat)
