## Concepts

- **Team**
  - Made up of channels
  - Every team has at least one channel (usually called "General"), which can't be deleted
  - You could create an **org-wide team** that automatically adds everyone in your organization
  - You can create a team from a M365 group, you can see which M365 group has a team associated in the M365 Admin center

- **Channel**
  - Where files are shared, apps are added
  - Types:
    - Standard: accessible to all members in the team
    - Private: selected members
    - Shared: **TODO: how does this work?**
  - Team members can adjust or limit notifications they're getting from a channel
  - Messages here are called **posts**, organized in threads
